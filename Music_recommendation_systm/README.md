# 🎶 Song Recommendation System

## Overview
This project implements a song recommendation system based on lyric similarity. It uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to vectorize song lyrics and cosine similarity to find songs with similar lyrical content.

## Features
- Data collection from Kaggle (Spotify Million Song Dataset).
- Data preprocessing including text cleaning, lowercasing, tokenization, and stop word removal.
- TF-IDF vectorization of song lyrics.
- Cosine similarity calculation between song lyrics to find similar songs.
- A function to recommend songs based on a given song title.
- A Streamlit application for an interactive recommendation interface.

## Dataset
The system utilizes the **Spotify Million Song Dataset** sourced from Kaggle. Due to the large size of the original dataset, a sample of 20,000 songs is used for this application.

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Kaggle API Key
To download the dataset, you need a Kaggle API key. 
- Go to Kaggle, log in, and navigate to your account settings.
- Under the 'API' section, click 'Create New API Token'. This will download `kaggle.json`.
- Upload this `kaggle.json` file to your Colab environment or the root directory of your project if running locally.

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install kaggle numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk wordcloud streamlit
```

### 3. NLTK Data Downloads
Ensure you have the necessary NLTK data downloaded:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

### 4. Running the Notebook (Colab/Jupyter)
Execute the cells sequentially in the provided Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab environment.

## How to Use

### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
The notebook first loads the dataset from Kaggle, preprocesses the lyrics, and then creates TF-IDF vectors and computes the cosine similarity matrix. 

### 2. Song Recommendation Function
Use the `recommend_songs` function to get recommendations:

### 3. Streamlit Application
An interactive Streamlit application is provided to easily get song recommendations.

**To run the Streamlit app:**
1.  Create a file, for example, `main.py` in this file add the streamlit application code.
2.  Ensure `music.pkl` (generated by the notebook) is in the same directory as `main.py`.
3.  Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved `main.py`.
4.  Run the command: 
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
5.  This will open the Streamlit application in your web browser, where you can enter a song title to get recommendations.

## Example Output (from `recommend_songs` function)

**Input**: `"American Dream"`
